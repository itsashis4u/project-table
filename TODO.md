Problem

Build a student record system, with two routes

/addstudent
/liststudent

Student Fields : Name, Phone Number, Class, City

1. Liststudent should list all students with columns sortable by just clicking on the header. It should show current sort status with up arrow / down arrow. Please note you need to write this functionality using JavaScript/Meteor so please don't use any third party library.

2. Notification System : Whenever a system user adds a student, it show as notification on all the system who are using the system currently. This notification will appear on top right corner and will stay there for few seconds before fading away. It should not be intrusive with existing UI flow.

3. Row highlights : Along with notifications, whenever a student is added, it will get automatically added in the student list due to reactive system. Now each new row when added should get highlighted background for few seconds.
